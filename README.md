Speech Enabled Address Capture for 311
======================================

A Tropo application that uses speech recognition to capture an address.  Built with PHP and CouchDB allows an ordinary telephone (or any cell phone) to be used to capture an address for a 311 service request.

Early days yet, lots of changes to come.  All feedback welcomed - mheadd@voiceingov.org
